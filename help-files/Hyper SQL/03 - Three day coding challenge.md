## Three day coding challenge

Hyper SQL was created and implemented in 3 days. Partically because of that I was tired
of (some) developers mistrusting me as I told them what Hyperlambda can actually do, and partially because
I wanted to demonstrate how much ground you can actually cover with a _"5th generation programming language"_,
such as Hyperlambda, once you drop your assumptions and your _"astronaut architecture ideas"_.
So I set out to implement _"MySQL Admin for ASP.NET"_, and I didn't want to use more than 3 days
implementing it, documenting my development as I proceeded - Aiming to improve security, bandwidth
consumption, and usability by at least 10x in the process.

After 3 days, I consider it to be stable, extremely secure, and out of _"BETA"_. It's maybe not
equally rich in features as MySQL Workbench or PHPMyAdmin, but then again, I suspect a lot of those
features, are not really necessary, and simply ads to the _"cognitive noise"_, as a new user
tries to learn these systems. In fact, the _only_ feature I miss myself at the time of this
writing, is _"in-place-editing"_ in the resulting datagrid, and the ability to create backups
and, restore backups of tables and databases - Which I'll probably end up implementing some rainy
day over the next couple of months ...

A third and more _"personal"_ argument for creating Hyper SQL, is the fact that I accidentally resized
my _"output window"_ in MySQL Workbench some three months ago, and I **still haven't figured out how
to make it visible again**! For the record; __No__! I am not interested in somebody telling me how to
fix this. My primary interest is to have _working software_ on my computer. Software that solves my
problems, without a 57 long list of items of what to do, if you accidentally _"resize your windows
into oblivion"_. Life is too short to spend it Googling the solution for how to resize your output
window in MySQL Workbench, after accidentally having resized it to zero pixels height. Besides, creating
an alternative piece of software, which was better in most regards, arguably took me less time ... ;)

Hence, I decided to make something (at least) 10x better than MySQL Workbench, and I decided to implement
it in three days, and I set out to make it work on **your phone**. I love MySQL, but not MySQL
Workbench _"so much"_ as you probably understand by now.

Since I realize developers will suspect that my _"3 days coding challenge"_ as described above is an
exaggeration, I have documented my development. Below is a video demonstrating what I
had finished after one day of development. Make sure you take notice of the date on my computer, and
the date the project was initially created on GitHub.

Below is a video demonstrating how it was, after two more days of coding.

PS, I coded roughly 7 hours the first day, some 3 hours the second day, and roughly 3 hours the third day ...
