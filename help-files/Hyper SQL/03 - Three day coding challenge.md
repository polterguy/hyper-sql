## Three day coding challenge

**Warning**, personal rant coming up ...

Hyper SQL was created and implemented in _3 days_. Partically because of that I was tired
of (some) developers mistrusting me as I tell them what Hyperlambda can actually do, and partially because
I wanted to demonstrate how much ground you can actually cover with a _"5th generation programming language"_,
such as Hyperlambda, once you ditch your assumptions in regards to _"astronaut architecture"_.
So I set out to implement _"MySQL Admin for ASP.NET"_, and I didn't want to use more than 3 days
implementing it, documenting my development as I proceeded. Aiming to improve security, bandwidth
consumption, and usability by at least 10x in the process.

After 3 days, I consider it to be stable, extremely secure, and out of _"BETA"_. It's maybe not
equally rich in features as MySQL Workbench or PHPMyAdmin, but then again, I suspect a lot of those
features, are not really needed either, and simply ads to the _"cognitive noise"_ as a new user
tries to learn these systems. In fact, the _only_ feature I miss myself at the time of this
writing, is _"in-place-editing"_ in the resulting datagrid, and the ability to create backups
and restore backups of tables and databases. Which I'll probably end up implementing in a couple
of hours, a week or 5 from now ...

A third and more _"personal"_ argument for creating Hyper SQL, is the fact that I accidentally resized
my _"output window"_ in MySQL Workbench some three months ago, and I **still haven't figured out how
to make it visible again**! But then again, what do I know, I've only been coding since I was 8.
For the record; __No__, I am not interested in somebody telling me how to fix this. My primary
interest is to have _working software_ on my computer! Software that solves my problems, without a
57 long list of items of what to do, if you accidentally _"resize your windows into oblivion"_.

Considering the above a _"personal insult towards myself and my profession"_, I decided to make something
(at least) 10x better than MySQL Workbench, and I decided to implement it in three days, and I set out
to make it work on **your phone**. I love MySQL,
but not MySQL Workbench _"so much"_ you might argue. In such a way, I have the same relationship to
MySQL/Workbench as I have for .Net/Visual Studio.

Since I realize developers will suspect that my _"3 days coding challenge"_ as described above is a lie,
or at least an exaggeration, I have documented my development. Below is a video demonstrating what I
had finished after one day of development. Make sure you take notice of the date on my computer, and
the date the project was initially created on GitHub.

Below is a video demonstrating how it was, after two more days of coding.
